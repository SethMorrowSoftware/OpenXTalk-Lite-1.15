# Installs OXT-Beyond for the current user, from the folder this script is
# in (the extracted OXT-Beyond-<version>-linux-x86_64.tar.xz):
#
#   ${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/oxt-beyond/   a copy of the folder
#   .../applications/oxt-beyond.desktop            the menu entry; it opens
#                                                  .oxtstack and .oxtscript
#   .../icons/hicolor/<n>x<n>/apps/oxt-beyond.png  the icon, 16 to 512 px
#   .../mime/packages/oxt-beyond.xml               the two file types
#   ~/.local/bin/oxt-beyond                        a link to the launcher
#
# and runs update-desktop-database and update-mime-database where they
# exist, and gtk-update-icon-cache where the icon folder already has a
# cache (creating one would hide the icons that other programs install
# later without updating it). Nothing needs root, and it refuses to run as
# root: the files belong in one user's home folder.
#
# Every file, link and folder it creates is listed in
# oxt-beyond/.install-manifest, which uninstall.sh reads to remove exactly
# those again (and the program folder); a file it did not create is never
# replaced or removed. Running it again replaces the installed copy (a newer
# version, say) and removes what the previous install created that this one
# does not. Run from the installed copy itself, it only registers the menu
# entry, icons, file types and link again. An install that fails part of
# the way still leaves the manifest (see die), so that install.sh again or
# uninstall.sh can finish or undo it.
#
# POSIX sh only (dash, bash, busybox sh).
