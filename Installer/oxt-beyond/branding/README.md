# OXT-Beyond artwork: 0.2.1 "Frankenstein"

From 0.2.1 the icon is an orange "OXT" struck by lightning over a
stitched seam and "BEYOND", on a charcoal tile with an orange rim. The
splash screens, the installer art and the release banner are the
"Frankenstein" drawings: a friendly flat-top monster with neck bolts, a
stitched scar and lightning, on a charcoal background. The earlier icon,
Tom Perry's OpenXTalk Lite icon with "Lite" replaced by "Beyond", is in
the history of this folder (up to 0.2.1-rc.6); his original stays in
`ide/OpenXTalk-lite_1024.ico`.

## Files

| File | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `draw_branding.py` | Draws every picture below and writes every file made from them. |
| `svg/icon.svg` | The icon (1024 × 1024): "OXT", lightning, a stitched seam and "BEYOND" on a rounded tile. |
| `svg/icon-small.svg` | "OXT" and the lightning alone, larger, for 16 to 48 px, where the seam and "BEYOND" would be a pixel or two. |
| `svg/splash-dark.svg`, `svg/splash-light.svg` | The IDE splash screens (1182 × 612), for the dark and light appearance. |
| `svg/wizard.svg` | The tall image of the Windows installer (534 × 1022). |
| `svg/banner.svg` | The release banner (1280 × 640), for the GitHub release, the repository's social preview and forum posts. |
| `png/oxt-beyond-<size>.png` | The icon at 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 128, 256, 512 and 1024 px. |
| `art/oxt-beyond-wizard.png`, `art/oxt-beyond-banner.png` | The installer image and the banner. They are kept out of `png/`, whose every file packaging puts into the macOS icon. |

Made by `draw_branding.py` elsewhere in the repository:

| File | Used for |
| --- | --- |
| `ide/OXT-Beyond.ico` | 16 to 128 px as 32-bit bitmaps and 256 px as PNG (`tools/oxt/ico.py`); the installer, shortcuts and file associations. |
| `engine/rsrc/oxt-beyond.ico` | The same icon, compiled into the development engine (packaged as `OXT-Beyond.exe`) as icon 111 by `engine/rsrc/development.rc`. Standalone applications keep their own icon (`standalone.rc` is unchanged). |
| `ide/Toolset/resources/community/ideSkin/splash.png`, `splash-light.png` and their `@extra-high` versions | The splash screens at 591 × 306 and 1182 × 612. |

Made from these files elsewhere:

| What | How |
| --- | --- |
| The macOS app icon, `OXT-Beyond.icns` | `tools/oxt/package.py` with `tools/oxt/icns.py`, from `png/`, when a package is staged. |
| The Linux menu icons | `tools/oxt/package.py` copies `png/oxt-beyond-16.png` to `-512.png` into the package. |
| The installer's wizard images | `Installer/oxt-beyond/make-wizard-images.ps1`: the tall image from `art/oxt-beyond-wizard.png`, the small one from the icon. |
| The icon in the About window and in answer and ask dialogs | Images `oxt-l-32.png` and `oxt-l-64.png` in `ide/Toolset/palettes/revgeneralicons.rev`, replaced with `png/oxt-beyond-32.png` and `-64.png` by the image patch `tools/oxt/ide-stack-patches/branding-dialog-icons.txt`. |

The release name, "Frankenstein", is in `ide/.codename`: the About window
shows it under the version, and the Release workflow puts it in the title
of the GitHub release.

## The splash screens

The art carries the product and release name. The IDE writes the rest
over it (`ide/Toolset/palettes/splash/revsplashstackbehavior.livecodescript`,
at 1x): "<version> · It's alive!" in grey 20 px text under the stitches
(field "moreinfo", 24,134 to 560,170), and the loading status in the
darker band at the bottom (field "Status", 5,270 to 478,293). The stack's
own field "Info" (product and version) is hidden.

## Making the files again

From the repository root, on any system:

```
python3 -m pip install cairosvg
python3 Installer/oxt-beyond/branding/draw_branding.py
```

It needs CairoSVG and the DejaVu Sans font (part of most Linux
distributions). To change a picture, edit the drawing functions in
`draw_branding.py`, or edit an SVG file in a vector editor and run
`draw_branding.py --render-only`, which keeps the SVG files and only
renders them. After changing `png/oxt-beyond-32.png` or `-64.png`, update
the `from-sha1:` lines of `tools/oxt/ide-stack-patches/branding-dialog-icons.txt`
to the old images' digests and run `tools/oxt/ide-stack-patch.sh`.

## Colours
