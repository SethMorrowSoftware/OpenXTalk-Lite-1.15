"""List the build's own tools in a Linux or macOS build output, for the CI
tarballs to leave out.

  python3 tools/ci/list_build_tools.py DIR

DIR is a build output folder (linux-<arch>-bin, _build/mac/Release). The
Linux and macOS builds leave the tools they make to build themselves in
it (tools/oxt/package.py BUILD_PROGRAMS: gentle-target and
reflex-target, which are GENTLE 97, whose licence forbids redistributing
it (THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md "GENTLE"); perfect-target, the lc-compile
bootstrap stages, zic and lcidlc), with their .dbg files or .dSYM
bundles. The CI artifacts of the build (OXT-Beyond-<platform>-bin and
-symbols) are downloadable, so they must not carry GENTLE either; nothing
that uses those artifacts needs any of these tools (package.py never
installs them, and package_dist.py leaves them out of the binaries and
symbols archives in the same way).

Prints every entry at the top of DIR that package_dist.build_tool()
counts, the same rule as the release archives, one per line and sorted,
as <base name of DIR>/<entry>: the paths that "tar -C <parent of DIR>
... <base name of DIR>" stores, for tar's --exclude-from (-X) and for
filtering a "find <base name of DIR>" list with grep -vxF -f. Prints
nothing when there are none. Exit status 2 when DIR is not a folder.

Only the Python 3 standard library is used (3.8 or newer: the Ubuntu
20.04 build container has 3.8).
