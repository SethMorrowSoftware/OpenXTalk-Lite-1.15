"""Put the files of one OXT-Beyond release together from the packages of
the three platforms, and check them before and after they are uploaded.

  python3 tools/ci/release_assets.py assemble --version V --artifacts DIR --out DIR
  python3 tools/ci/release_assets.py check-uploaded --dir DIR --assets FILE
  python3 tools/ci/release_assets.py list --version V

The release workflow (.github/workflows/release.yml) downloads the CI
artifacts that hold the packages, each into a folder of its own named
after it, as actions/download-artifact writes a named artifact:

  OXT-Beyond-win-x86_64     build-windows.yml, job "Build win-x86_64"
  OXT-Beyond-mac-universal  build-macos.yml, job "Package mac-universal"
  OXT-Beyond-linux-x86_64   build-linux.yml, job "Package linux-x86_64"

assemble checks each artifact folder of --artifacts:

  - its SHA256SUMS lists every other file of the folder once, and every
    file matches its line (a file that changed or went missing between
    packaging and the release fails here, not on a user's computer);
  - it holds exactly the files ASSETS names for it, where <root> is
    OXT-Beyond-<version>: none missing, and none that the table does not
    name (a new kind of file is added to the table on purpose, together
    with its description in tools/ci/release_notes.py);

and across the artifacts that no file name comes from two of them: the
xTalk sources zip, which every platform's packages share, is written
once, by the Windows job. Nothing else in DIR is looked at (the build
and test logs, the per-architecture build outputs), and nothing is
written when a check fails. Then it links (or, across file systems,
copies) every file except the artifacts' own SHA256SUMS into --out and
writes one SHA256SUMS there over all of them: "<sha256>  <name>" lines,
sorted by name (byte order), LF line endings, as sha256sum writes them,
so that "sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS --ignore-missing" checks any one
download.

check-uploaded compares the files of --dir (the assembled release, with
its SHA256SUMS) with the release's assets as GitHub lists them, one per
line of --assets: name, size in bytes, state and digest, separated by
tabs (the digest "sha256:<hex>" may be empty: GitHub computes it only
for assets uploaded since mid-2025). Every file must be an asset with
the same size, the state "uploaded" and, where GitHub gives one, the
same SHA-256; and no other asset may be there.

list prints the names of the release's files for --version, one per
line (SHA256SUMS last).

Exit status: 0 success, 1 failed checks (listed; under GitHub Actions as
::error:: annotations), 2 usage errors.

Only the Python 3 standard library is used.
