# Why a container of its own: Ubuntu has no i386 images after 18.04, and
# GitHub's JavaScript actions (checkout, cache, upload) cannot run inside a
# 32-bit job container. So the job runs on the x86_64 runner, the actions
# run there, and this script runs the build commands in the container.
# Debian 11 has the same glibc (2.31) and the libstdc++ of GCC 10 that the
# other Linux legs' Ubuntu 20.04 has, so the 32-bit files need no newer
# system than the 64-bit ones. Every command runs under linux32, so that
# uname -m says i686: the build scripts (prebuilt/scripts/platform.inc) and
# gyp (config/arch.gypi) take it for the machine's own architecture, and
# nothing is cross-compiled.
#
# The workspace and RUNNER_TEMP are mounted at the same paths as on the
# runner, so paths in variables mean the same inside and outside. The
# variables passed into the container are the build's (ARCH, MODE,
# BUILDTYPE, OXT_*, PREBUILT_*, CI and GitHub's step files).
