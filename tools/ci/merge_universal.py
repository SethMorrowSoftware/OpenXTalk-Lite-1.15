"""Join the arm64 and the x86_64 macOS build outputs into one universal
build output, and check that a tree holds universal code.

  python tools/ci/merge_universal.py --arm64 DIR --x86_64 DIR --out DIR
      [--dry-run | --no-lipo] [--report FILE]

  python tools/ci/merge_universal.py --check DIR [--no-lipo]

The macOS workflow builds each architecture natively on its own runner,
and both CI tarballs unpack as Release/ (_build/mac/Release). Extract each
into a folder of its own (and its symbols tarball over it, which puts
every .dSYM bundle next to its binary), then pass the two Release folders.
Every path of the two trees is looked at once:

  Mach-O files     at the same path in both: joined with "lipo -create";
                   the arm64 build's copy must hold arm64 only and the
                   x86_64 build's x86_64 only. The DWARF files inside the
                   .dSYM bundles are Mach-O files too, so the debug
                   symbols become universal the same way.
  other files      compared byte for byte and copied once. A file that
                   differs is an error unless DIFFER explains it (see
                   there: the bundles' Info.plist and resource seals).
                   After writing, an Info.plist whose LSArchitecturePriority
                   puts x86_64 before arm64 while its bundle's executable
                   is universal now gets arm64, x86_64 there, and nothing
                   else changes (fix_arch_priority).
  one build only   an error unless ONE_SIDED explains it.
  SINGLE_ARCH      Mach-O files that hold one architecture by design
                   (reviphoneproxy, the iOS simulator helper, which both
                   builds make for x86_64 only): the named build's copy is
                   taken, whatever the other build has at that path.
  symbolic links   must be the same in both, and stay links.
  modes, dates     kept (a file whose mode differs between the builds is
                   an error); folders, empty ones too, are the union.

Then every Mach-O file of the result must hold exactly arm64 and x86_64,
except SINGLE_ARCH (the check below). Nothing is written when the plan has
a problem. Exit status 0 success, 1 problems (listed), 2 usage errors.

--dry-run   only plans and reports; writes nothing (lipo is not needed).
--no-lipo   writes the tree, joining the slices with this script's own
            fat-file writer instead of lipo (write_fat): for trying the
            merge and what follows it on a host without lipo, such as
            Linux or WSL. The CI job runs lipo.
--report    writes every path with what was done to it, as TSV.

--check DIR (the merged tree or the assembled OXT-Beyond.app): every
Mach-O file of macOS code must hold exactly arm64 and x86_64, except
SINGLE_ARCH and code in an architecture's own folder of an extension
(code/arm64-mac*, code/x86_64-mac*, which the IDE maps by the processor).
Code for other platforms (the time zone library's iOS and iOS simulator
files, from the runtimes asset) is listed but not checked: its slices are
for iOS, which the macOS app only copies into iOS standalones. When lipo
is on PATH (and without --no-lipo), "lipo -archs" of every file must also
agree with what tools/oxt/binfmt.py reads. A bundle's Contents/Info.plist
must not put x86_64 before arm64 in LSArchitecturePriority when its
executable holds both (LaunchServices would start it under Rosetta on
Apple Silicon).

Only the Python 3 standard library is used (3.8 or later); lipo only
without --dry-run and --no-lipo.
