"""Write the release notes of an OXT-Beyond release for Windows, macOS and
Linux (Markdown, for gh release create --notes-file).

  python3 tools/ci/release_notes.py --version V [--commit SHA]
      (--dir DIR | --files NAME... | --files-from FILE)
      [--out FILE] [--excerpt] [--strict] [--summary]

The files are the release's (tools/ci/release_assets.py: --dir is the
folder that its "assemble" wrote; --files and --files-from, one name per
line, give the names alone, to try the notes without the files). They
must be exactly the files release_assets.py expects for --version, so the
notes never name a file that the release lacks, nor leave one out. A
version with a pre-release part (0.1.0-beta.1: anything after a "-") is
a pre-release, as release.yml marks it on GitHub.

The first lines are what every user of the IDE's update check sees:
ide/Toolset/libraries/oxtbeyondupdater.livecodescript shows at most 12
lines of the notes (runs of empty lines counted as one, Markdown heading
marks dropped) and at most 700 characters, as plain text. So the notes
open with INTRO: what the release is, which file to download for each
platform and its minimum system, the Gatekeeper step of the macOS app,
the extensions' higher minimums, and a pointer to the rest; no Markdown
links or code spans there, which the dialog would show as they are.
Then one section per platform with its files and what it needs, the
files of all platforms and how to check them against SHA256SUMS, and
where the parts come from. GitHub's generated list of changes since the
previous release follows when release.yml creates the release (gh
release create --generate-notes --notes-start-tag).

--excerpt prints what the update check shows of these notes (see
updater_excerpt) instead of the notes. The script checks that the
excerpt is exactly INTRO, whole; when it is not (a very long version
string can push it over 700 characters), it warns, or with --strict
fails. --summary appends the excerpt and the notes to the GitHub
Actions job summary.

Only the Python 3 standard library is used.

OXT-Beyond {version} for Windows, macOS and Linux.{pre}

Download from the release page, under Assets:
- {windows_min}: {root}-win-x86_64-setup.exe
- {mac_min}: {root}-mac-universal.dmg
- {linux_min}: {root}-linux-x86_64.tar.xz

The Mac app is not notarized, so macOS blocks it until you allow it (see below).

Some bundled xTalk extensions need macOS 15, or on Linux glibc 2.33 (SodiumXT) or 2.38 and OpenSSL 3 (DataChannelXT).

The notes below list every file, what each platform needs, and how to check downloads.
'''

BODY = '''\
## Windows (x64)

Needs 64-bit Windows 10 or later.

- `{root}-win-x86_64-setup.exe`: the installer. It installs for all users or only for you, and adds a Start menu shortcut and the .oxtstack and .oxtscript file types.
- `{root}-win-x86_64-portable.zip`: the same program folder without an installer. Extract it and run `OXT-Beyond.exe`.
- `{root}-win-x86_64-binaries.zip`: the engine, externals and tools as built (`win-x86_64-bin`), without debug symbols, plus the licence files.
- `{root}-win-x86_64-symbols.zip`: debug symbols (`*.pdb`) for the binaries.

The executables are not code-signed, so Windows SmartScreen may warn when they are run for the first time.

## macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel)

One universal app, `OXT-Beyond.app`. It needs macOS 11 Big Sur or later on Apple Silicon, or macOS 10.13 High Sierra or later on an Intel Mac. The native libraries of the bundled xTalk Suite extensions SodiumXT, TorrentXT, enetxt, DataChannelXT, Box2Dxt and CoinXT need macOS 15 Sequoia or later: on older macOS the IDE starts, but those extensions do not load.

- `{root}-mac-universal.dmg`: the disk image. Open it and drag OXT-Beyond onto the Applications folder next to it.
- `{root}-mac-universal.zip`: the same app, for scripted installs (`ditto -x -k {root}-mac-universal.zip /Applications`).
- `{root}-mac-universal-binaries.tar.xz`: the build output (`Release/`, the Apple Silicon and Intel builds joined with lipo), signed ad hoc, without debug symbols and the build's own tools, plus the licence files.
- `{root}-mac-universal-symbols.zip`: debug symbols (`.dSYM` bundles) for the binaries.

**Opening it for the first time.** The app is signed ad hoc: it is not signed with an Apple Developer ID and not notarized by Apple, so macOS does not open a downloaded copy until you allow it. You do this once. On macOS 15 Sequoia and later:

1. Double-click OXT-Beyond. macOS says that it was not opened; click **Done** (not *Move to Trash*).
2. Open **System Settings > Privacy & Security** and scroll down to *Security*. Next to "OXT-Beyond was blocked to protect your Mac", click **Open Anyway**.
3. Confirm with **Open Anyway** and your password (or Touch ID).

On macOS 13 and 14, Control-click the app in Finder, choose *Open* and then *Open* again; on macOS 12 and earlier, the button is in *System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General*. Or, in Terminal, remove the quarantine flag that the browser set on the download:

```sh
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/OXT-Beyond.app
```

The same command helps if macOS says the app "is damaged and can't be opened": that is how some macOS versions report an app that is not notarized.

## Linux (x86-64)

Needs 64-bit x86 Linux with glibc 2.31 or later (Ubuntu 20.04, Debian 11, Fedora 32 or later) and an X11 desktop (on Wayland it runs through XWayland), with GTK 2: on Debian and Ubuntu the package `libgtk2.0-0` (`libgtk2.0-0t64` on Ubuntu 24.04 and Debian 13), on Fedora `gtk2`. The launcher names any library that is missing, with its package. The browser widget and revBrowser also need NSS, ALSA and a few more X11 libraries; without them the launcher turns the browser off. Of the bundled xTalk Suite extensions, SodiumXT needs glibc 2.33 (Ubuntu 21.04, Debian 12, Fedora 34 or later) and DataChannelXT glibc 2.38 and OpenSSL 3 (Ubuntu 24.04, Debian 13, Fedora 39 or later); on an older system these two do not load, and the IDE and the other extensions work.

- `{root}-linux-x86_64.tar.xz`: the program folder `{root}`. Extract it onto a Linux file system (not FAT, exFAT or a Windows drive) and run `./oxt-beyond` in it, or run `./install.sh` to install it for yourself: under `~/.local/share/oxt-beyond`, with a menu entry, icons, the .oxtstack and .oxtscript file types and the command `oxt-beyond`, without administrator rights.
- `{root}-linux-x86_64-binaries.tar.xz`: the engine, externals and tools as built (`linux-x86_64-bin`), without debug symbols and the build's own tools, plus the licence files.
- `{root}-linux-x86_64-symbols.tar.xz`: debug symbols (`.dbg` files) for the binaries.

## All platforms

- `{root}-xtalk-sources.zip`: every file of the bundled xTalk Suite extensions as this release took it from their repositories, with the manifest that pins them, so that the release can be rebuilt without those repositories (see BUILDING.md, "xTalk Suite extensions").
- `SHA256SUMS`: SHA-256 checksums of all the files above.

**Checking a download.** Compare its SHA-256 with the line for it in `SHA256SUMS`:

- Windows, in Command Prompt: `certutil -hashfile {root}-win-x86_64-setup.exe SHA256`
- macOS, in Terminal: `shasum -a 256 {root}-mac-universal.dmg`
- Linux, in the folder with the download and `SHA256SUMS`: `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS --ignore-missing`

## About this release

Made by the "Release" workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`){commit}, which builds and tests all three platforms and publishes the release only when every package has passed.

The programs include the xTalk Suite extensions (SodiumXT, TorrentXT, enetxt, DataChannelXT, Box2Dxt, CoinXT, OnionXT and NostrXT) in their `Extensions` folder, taken from their own repositories at the commits listed in `Extensions/XTALK-EXTENSIONS.txt`. The Windows packages include the Microsoft Visual C++ runtime DLLs that enetxt and Box2Dxt need; the macOS and Linux packages do not, so a Windows standalone built there with either of them needs the Visual C++ Redistributable on the PC that runs it.

Each package's engine, externals and tools are built from this repository, for Windows x86-64, for macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel, joined into universal files) and for Linux x86-64, and so are the standalone runtimes every package carries for Windows (x86-64 and x86) and Linux (x86-64 and x86), with the time zone library code for them. The Android standalone runtime is not built here: it is taken unchanged from OpenXTalk Lite 1.15 (stock LiveCode 9.6.3 builds and files as Tom Perry shipped them; see THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md). Only the macOS package has the macOS runtimes.

OXT-Beyond continues OpenXTalk Lite, started by Terry Little and developed by Tom Perry with contributions from the OpenXTalk community. It is based on LiveCode Community and licensed under the GNU GPL version 3.
