The Windows archives have the names and the entries (names, bytes, file
dates, folder entries) that tools/ci/package-windows.ps1 writes with .NET's
ZipArchive; the order of the entries can differ (PowerShell sorts by
culture rules, this by lower-case name), and so can the compressed bytes:
.NET's Optimal is Windows' own zlib build, which no level of Python's zlib
reproduces (level 9, the default here, comes closest in size). An empty
folder's entry gets the folder's date (.NET stamps the time it writes the
entry). The Windows CI keeps using package-windows.ps1 for now, which also
finds the Visual C++ runtime with vswhere.

Unix archives keep what package.py staged: modes, symbolic links and empty
folders, owner and group 0 with no names, file dates in whole seconds
(clamped to SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH when it is set), entries sorted. In a Linux
package, staged files of 64 KiB or more with the same content and mode are
stored once and hard-linked (--no-hardlinks stores each): the runtime's
copies of libcef.so and the rest of CEF are the same files as the IDE's.
Such a tarball must be extracted onto a file system that has hard links
(not FAT, which could not hold the package's modes anyway). The macOS
zip is ditto's own on macOS (it keeps everything the signed app has; a
signature lives inside its files, so nothing needs the "__MACOSX" side
files that --sequesterRsrc would write for extended attributes, which
tools/ci/sign_mac_app.py removes); elsewhere, or with OXT_PYTHON_ZIP=1,
this script writes one that stores folders, symbolic links (as links)
and each file's mode, as ditto does, so that the app keeps its
executables and bundle structure where the zip is extracted (ditto -x -k,
Archive Utility or unzip). They are written on Linux or macOS only; in
WSL the stage must be under a Linux path, since a Windows drive reports
every file as 0777 (a probe file next to the stage,
package.unix_tree_problem, refuses one).

--dmg (a macOS layout, on macOS) also writes the disk image: the app is
copied with ditto into a temporary folder next to a symbolic link to
/Applications, and "hdiutil create -format UDZO -fs HFS+" makes the
image of that folder (HFS+ rather than APFS: every macOS the app runs on
reads it, and it matches the case-insensitive names package.py checks
for). hdiutil sometimes fails with "Resource busy" while something
still scans the new files, so it is tried up to four times; then
"hdiutil verify" checks the image's checksum. Sign the app before this
step: the image and the zip hold it as it is.

A tarball given as --bin-tar is read once, as a stream: each member goes
to the binaries or the symbols archive under the platform's folder name
(win-x86_64-bin, linux-<arch>-bin, Release), without macOS tar's "._"
AppleDouble files; modes and links are kept, owners dropped. The CI keeps
the debug symbols out of its bin tarball, in a tarball of their own (the
same folder with only the *.dbg files, or the *.dSYM bundles):
--symbols-tar adds its files to the symbols archive, and fails on anything
in it that is not a debug symbol file or that the build output has too.

In the Linux package no path may have a folder named like a build output
(package.repository_mode_trap: _build, linux-bin, linux-<arch>-bin,
build-linux-<arch>), which would switch an engine on that path into
repository mode.

The Linux and macOS build outputs also hold the tools the build makes to
build itself (package.BUILD_PROGRAMS: gentle-target, reflex-target,
perfect-target, the lc-compile bootstrap stages, zic, lcidlc), which
package.py never installs. Their files, .dSYM bundles and .dbg files are
left out of the binaries and symbols archives, from a folder and from a
tarball alike, and counted in the log: gentle-target and reflex-target
are GENTLE 97, whose licence forbids redistributing it
(THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md "GENTLE"), and the Windows binaries zip holds
none of them either. Any entry named gentle-* or reflex-* that still
reaches an archive is an error, and no archive is written.

Under GitHub Actions it writes the step outputs version, package-root,
platform, dist-dir, package (the main archive), dmg (with --dmg) and
sha256sums, and a table of the archives to the job summary.

Only the Python 3 standard library is used.
