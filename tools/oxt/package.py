"""Stage the installed layout of OXT-Beyond for one platform.

  python tools/oxt/package.py [--platform P] --repo <repo>
      (--bin <build output> | --bin-tar <CI build tarball>)
      --out <stage-parent> [--build-number N] [--assets-cache DIR]
      [--no-external-assets] [--no-xtalk-extensions] [--xtalk-compiler-bin DIR]
      [--vc-redist DIR] [--allow-unpinned-vc-runtime] [--xtalk-cache DIR]
      [--eol lf|crlf|keep] [--allow-single-arch] [--summary-json FILE]
      [--compare <reference install or TSV> [--report FILE]]

P chooses the layout (PLATFORMS below; default win-x86_64):

  win-x86_64     OXT-Beyond.exe and everything else in one folder: what the
                 portable zip holds and Inno Setup installs. --bin defaults
                 to <repo>/win-x86_64-bin.
  linux-x86_64   the engine as OXT-Beyond and everything else in one folder:
                 what the portable tar.xz holds. --bin defaults to
                 <repo>/linux-x86_64-bin.
  linux-arm64    the same from an arm64 build, for staging only: the IDE has
                 no Linux arm64 standalone target and that build has no CEF,
                 so there is no browser and no Runtime folder of its own.
  mac-universal  OXT-Beyond.app, with everything the other layouts have at
                 their root in OXT-Beyond.app/Contents/Tools, from a build
                 whose Mach-O files hold arm64 and x86_64 (the lipo merge of
                 the two CI builds). --bin defaults to <repo>/_build/mac/Release.
  mac-arm64, mac-x86_64
                 OXT-Beyond.app from one architecture's build, to check the
                 layout; --allow-single-arch lets mac-universal take one too.
  win-x86, linux-x86
                 the 32-bit builds, which are made for their standalone
                 runtimes (Runtime/Windows/x86-32, Runtime/Linux/x86-32):
                 tools/oxt/make_runtimes_asset.py --builds takes those from
                 them with this script's tables, for the runtimes asset that
                 every package installs. They are not packaged themselves.

--bin-tar takes the build output as the tarball a CI build uploads
(OXT-Beyond-linux-<arch>-bin.tar.xz, OXT-Beyond-mac-<arch>-bin.tar.xz):
its one top-level folder is extracted into a temporary folder first,
without the debug symbols (*.dbg, *.dSYM, *.pdb) and macOS tar's "._"
AppleDouble files, keeping file modes and symbolic links.

The Linux and macOS layouts are Unix trees, so they are staged on Linux or
macOS (or WSL, under a Linux path such as /tmp: a Windows drive such as
/mnt/c keeps neither modes nor letter case, and both this script and
package_dist.py refuse it, as a probe file shows), never on Windows,
which keeps neither modes nor symbolic links:

  modes        executable build outputs (any x bit) and native libraries
               (of the xTalk extensions, and asset members stored with an
               x bit) get 0755, every other file 0644 and every folder 0755,
               whatever the umask or the checkout (git marks some IDE
               images executable).
  links        a symbolic link inside a build output folder is staged as
               the same (relative) link; one that leads out of its folder
               or is absolute is an error. A build output named directly
               (not in a folder) is copied through a link.
  names        two paths that differ only in letter case are a conflict on
               Windows and macOS (whose volumes are usually
               case-insensitive), not on Linux.
  text         generated files (Externals.txt, Database Drivers.txt),
               Extensions/XTALK-EXTENSIONS.txt and the licence files get
               LF line endings; CRLF on Windows.

writes <stage-parent>/OXT-Beyond-<version>/, where <version> is the content
of ide/.version. An existing folder of that name is replaced. The folder is
what the platform's package holds (the portable zip and the installer on
Windows, the tar.xz on Linux; on macOS the folder holds OXT-Beyond.app). It
is put together from (paths relative to the tools folder, which is the
stage folder itself except on macOS):

  IDE          tools/oxt/layout.py assemble: ide/Toolset, Plugins, Resources,
               Documentation, Extensions, the ide/ root files and the 11
               ide-support scripts, plus the Sample Icons in
               Runtime/Windows/<arch>/Support (and, on macOS only,
               Resources/Mobile Examples: package.txt Mobile.MacOSX). Text
               files get LF line endings (--eol) so that the result does
               not depend on git's core.autocrlf.
  build        the files of --bin that Installer/package.txt installs on the
               platform, at its installed paths (see Platform and plan_build);
               the development engine becomes OXT-Beyond.exe, OXT-Beyond or
               OXT-Beyond.app. The platform's not_installed list gives the
               build outputs that are left out, and why.
  generated    edition.txt ("community"), Externals/Externals.txt and
               Externals/Database Drivers/Database Drivers.txt (at the root
               and under every runtime folder), .buildnumber (the build
               number), two empty dictionary folders (EMPTY_DIRS) and, on
               macOS, the app's Info.plist (mac_info_plist: the build's,
               with OXT-Beyond's bundle id, name, version, copyright,
               icon and document types, the renamed executable, the
               layout's architectures, arm64 first, and the lowest
               minimum macOS of the engine's slices) and its icon,
               Contents/Resources/OXT-Beyond.icns (tools/oxt/icns.py,
               from Installer/oxt-beyond/branding/png).
  licences     LICENSE, LICENSE-EXCEPTION.md and THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md from
               the repository root (CRLF line endings on Windows).
  assets       the archives in tools/oxt/external-assets.json (see
               fetch_assets.py), unless --no-external-assets.
  xtalk        the xTalk Suite extensions of tools/oxt/xtalk-extensions.json
               under Extensions/, byte for byte as
               tools/oxt/xtalk_extensions.py fetches and builds them (with
               the lc-compile of --xtalk-compiler-bin, default --bin: the
               compiled modules do not depend on the platform, so a macOS
               layout can be staged on Linux with a Linux build's compiler)
               in a temporary folder, plus Extensions/XTALK-EXTENSIONS.txt
               (with the platform's line endings); unless
               --no-xtalk-extensions. Every platform gets the native
               libraries of every platform id in the manifest, so that
               standalones for the other platforms can be built.
               --vc-redist is Visual Studio's redistributable folder
               (VCToolsRedistDir): the Visual C++ runtime DLLs that enetxt
               and box2dxt import are then copied next to them, and each
               must be the one the manifest's "vc_runtime" pins
               (--allow-unpinned-vc-runtime only warns); without
               --vc-redist packaging warns, and those two libraries cannot
               load on a PC without the Visual C++ Redistributable. The
               cache is --xtalk-cache, else OXT_XTALK_CACHE, else <asset
               cache>/xtalk.
  desktop      Linux only: the launcher oxt-beyond, install.sh and
               uninstall.sh (mode 0755) and linux/ with the desktop entry,
               the MIME types, the icons and the library list the launcher
               checks, from Installer/linux and the branding PNGs
               (LINUX_DESKTOP).

The build number is --build-number, else the environment variable
OXT_BUILD_NUMBER, else the current UTC time as YYYYMMDDHHMM. ide/.buildnumber
in the repository is a placeholder.

A warning says when the stage path has a folder name that makes the engine
run the IDE in repository mode (see repository_mode_trap): a package must
be tested from a neutral path.

--compare (win-x86_64 only) checks the staged tree against a reference
install (for example OpenXTalk Lite 1.15) or a TSV from "layout.py
classify" (also a part of one, such as only its build rows): every IDE,
build and external path of the reference must be staged (the engine under
its new name) unless an intended difference (INTENDED_MISSING) says why not,
and every staged path of the classes the reference lists must be in it
unless it is an intended addition (licence files, asset notices). With a
folder, external asset files must be byte-identical and empty folders must
match. IDE changes since the reference are listed but are not errors.

Exit status: 0 success, 1 unexplained differences (--compare), 2 errors
(missing build outputs, conflicts, asset download or checksum failures;
nothing is written when the plan has problems).

Only the Python 3 standard library is used.
