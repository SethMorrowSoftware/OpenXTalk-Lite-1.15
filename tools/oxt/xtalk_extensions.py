"""Pin, fetch and build the xTalk Suite extensions that OXT-Beyond ships
built in (tools/oxt/xtalk-extensions.json).

The extensions are consumed from their member repositories
(github.com/SethMorrowSoftware/<Repo>) at pinned commits; nothing of them is
kept in this repository. The manifest lists, per member, the repository, the
commit, a version and the exact files taken, each with the SHA-256 and size
of its git blob (LF line endings; a CRLF working copy has other bytes), and
the extensions made from them:

  lcb  a LiveCode Builder library: the .lcb source is compiled with the
       build's lc-compile into module.lcm and manifest.xml, and the member's
       native libraries (src/code/<platform-id>/<token>.<ext>, all platform
       ids the manifest lists) go into code/<platform-id>/;
  lcs  a LiveCode Script library (a script-only stack): the file is shipped
       with a 'script "<stack>"' header when it has none and an appended
       extensionInitialize / extensionFinalize pair, which the IDE sends to
       put the library into the message path; its manifest.xml is written
       from the JSON.

Every extension folder also gets the member's licence files in licenses/,
and one that ships Visual C++ runtime DLLs also a notice of Microsoft's
terms for them (licenses/Microsoft-Visual-C++-Runtime.txt).

Subcommands

  pin    [--member NAME] [--ref REF [--allow-off-branch]]
         resolve the member's commit (default: HEAD of its default branch,
         through git ls-remote or the GitHub API; it must be on the default
         branch, which --allow-off-branch waives for a branch or tag named
         by --ref, never for a SHA-1), download every listed file at that
         commit and rewrite the manifest with the commit, the version
         (version_from) and each file's sha256, size and, for Windows
         libraries, the DLLs it imports. Files with their own
         "repository" and "commit" (the OpenSSL licence text) keep their
         commit and are only re-hashed. This is how maintainers take a newer
         version of a member.
  fetch  [--cache DIR] [--offline] [--platforms LIST] [--member NAME]
         download every pinned file into the cache and verify its size and
         SHA-256 (a mismatch is fatal and the file is deleted), then check
         the native libraries against the member's src/code/MANIFEST.sha256.
  build  --bin DIR --out DIR [--platforms LIST] [--vc-redist DIR]
         [--allow-unpinned-vc-runtime] [--cache DIR] [--offline]
         fetch, then compile and assemble <out>/<folder>/ for every
         extension and write <out>/XTALK-EXTENSIONS.txt. Folders this tool
         made before (listed in the old XTALK-EXTENSIONS.txt) are replaced;
         nothing else in <out> is touched.
  pin-vc-runtime --vc-redist DIR
         pin the Visual C++ runtime DLLs that the Windows libraries need
         (from their recorded "imports", and what those DLLs import in
         turn) to their SHA-256 and size in that redistributable folder:
         rewrites the manifest's "vc_runtime" block.
  export --out FILE.zip [--cache DIR] [--offline]
         fetch, then write every pinned file (all members and platforms)
         into a reproducible zip in the cache layout <Repo>/<commit>/<path>,
         with a copy of the manifest. Tag builds attach it to the release,
         so that the release can be rebuilt ("build --cache <unzipped>
         --offline") even if a member repository loses the pinned commit.
  list   print the members, their extensions and probes.

The cache folder is --cache, else the environment variable OXT_XTALK_CACHE,
else the xtalk folder of the external-assets cache (OXT_ASSETS_CACHE, else
<repo>/prebuilt/fetched-assets, ignored by git), the same folder that
package.py uses; a file lives at <cache>/<Repo>/<commit>/<path>. Downloads
use tools/oxt/fetch_assets.py (HTTPS only, retries with backoff, verified
before they are moved into place).

The Visual C++ runtime. enetxt.dll and box2dxt.dll are built with the
dynamic CRT and import MSVCP140 / VCRUNTIME140 / VCRUNTIME140_1, which
Windows does not have without the Visual C++ Redistributable and which the
OXT-Beyond engine (static CRT) does not ship. With --vc-redist (Visual
Studio's redistributable folder, VCToolsRedistDir, which has
x64\\Microsoft.VC14x.CRT and x86\\Microsoft.VC14x.CRT) build copies every
DLL that a library in code/x86_64-win32 or code/x86-win32 imports and that
is neither a Windows system DLL (SYSTEM_DLLS) nor already in that folder
into the folder (app-local deployment; the engine loads extension libraries
with LOAD_WITH_ALTERED_SEARCH_PATH, so Windows looks for their DLLs next to
them first). Every copy must be the one "vc_runtime" in the manifest pins
(SHA-256 and size per platform and DLL), so that the package does not
depend on which Visual Studio the build machine has; with
--allow-unpinned-vc-runtime (never for a release) another copy only
warns. It checks that the copies export every function the library
imports from them, which catches a redistributable that lacks a function
but not every older one, and warns when a copy's file version is older
than the MSVC linker that built the library (Microsoft supports only a
runtime at least as new as the newest toolset used). Without --vc-redist
it warns and lists the libraries that cannot load on a PC without the
redistributable.

Only the Python 3 standard library is used.

=====================================================

Every file that tools/oxt/xtalk-extensions.json (the copy in this zip)
pins, exactly as tools/oxt/xtalk_extensions.py downloaded and verified it
from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<repository>/<commit>/<path>, in the
layout of its download cache: <repository name>/<commit>/<path>.

The packages fetch these files from the member repositories when they are
made. This copy keeps a release reproducible if a member repository later
loses a pinned commit (a rewritten history, a renamed or private
repository). To rebuild the release, check out its tag, extract this zip
into an empty folder and package with that folder as the cache, offline:

  package-windows.ps1 -XtalkCache <folder> ...     (tools/ci)
  python tools/oxt/package.py --xtalk-cache <folder> --offline ...
  python tools/oxt/xtalk_extensions.py build --cache <folder> --offline ...

Every file is still checked against the size and SHA-256 in the manifest.
The licence of each file is that of its repository (see its licenses/
folder in the program's Extensions folder and THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md).
